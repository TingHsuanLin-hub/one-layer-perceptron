# one-layer-perceptron

## How to Train the classifier
1. Download the project.
2. Put the directory "images" into the root directory.
3. Compile Perceptron_array.cpp file and run it.  

## Explanation of File  
* Perceptron_array.cpp contains class **Perceptron** and **main**.  
* matrix.cpp defines a data format of matrix(for matrix multiplication and training in the future).  
* train.txt, val.txt, test.txt help generating datasets for training, validation, testing respectively.
